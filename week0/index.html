              <h3>Background</h3>
              <strong>Friends</strong> is an American television sitcom, created by <strong>David Crane and Marta Kauffman,</strong> which aired on <strong>NBC</strong> from 1994 till 2004, lasting ten seasons. With an ensemble cast starring <strong>Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer,</strong>        the show revolves six friends living in Manhattan. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Marta Kauffman, and David Crane.
              Kauffman and Crane began developing Friends under the title Insomnia Cafe between November and December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the show to NBC. After several script rewrites
              and changes, including a title change to Six of One and Friends Like Us, the series was finally named Friends. Friends received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular television shows of all time. The series was nominated
              for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Outstanding Comedy Series award in 2002 for its eighth season. The show ranked no. 21 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time and no. 7 on Empire magazine's The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.
              In 2013, Friends ranked no. 24 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 Best Written TV Series of All Time and no. 28 on TV Guide's 60 Best TV Series of All Time.<br>

              <h3>The Story</h3>
              <strong>Rachel Green</strong> flees her wedding day and finds childhood friend <strong>Monica Geller,</strong> a New York City chef. They become roommates, and Rachel joins Monica's social circle of single people in their mid-20s: struggling actor
              <strong>Joey Tribbiani,</strong> business professional <strong>Chandler Bing,</strong> masseuse and musician <strong>Phoebe Buffay,</strong> and newly divorced paleontologist <strong>Ross Geller,</strong> Monica's older brother. To support herself,
              Rachel becomes a waitress at Central Perk, a Manhattan coffeehouse where the group often hangs out; when not there, the six are usually at Monica and Rachel's nearby West Village apartment, or Joey and Chandler's across the hall. Episodes depict
              the friends' comedic and romantic adventures and career issues, such as Joey auditioning for roles or Rachel seeking jobs in the fashion industry. The six characters each have many dates and serious relationships, such as Monica with Richard Burke
              and Ross with Emily Waltham. Ross and Rachel's intermittent relationship is the most often-recurring storyline; during the ten seasons of the show they repeatedly date and break up, even while Ross briefly marries Emily, he and Rachel have a child,
              Chandler and Monica date and marry each other, and Phoebe marries Mike Hannigan. Other frequently recurring characters include Ross and Monica's parents in Long Island, Ross's ex-wife and their son, Central Perk barista Gunther, Chandler's ex-girlfriend
              Janice, and Phoebe's twin sister Ursula.<br>

                at an advertising agency.Chandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humor. An intelligent man at the end of the day (despite all his goofy quirkiness), he often mocks his best friend Joey for the latter's stupidity. Chandler is often depicted
                as being somewhat of a hapless individual, suffering a lot of bad luck while struggling through life and occasionally struggling with an on-and-off smoking addiction. However, he eventually falls in deep mutual love with Monica; an emotional
                Chandler tells her that she "makes him happier than he ever thought he could be" while proposing to her at the close of season six, with the two of them marrying at the close of season seven. By the end of series, he and Monica adopt twins,

                </a>Monica E. Geller-Bing (Courteney Cox) is the mother hen of the group, who is known for her obsessive-compulsive and competitive nature. Monica is often jokingly teased by the others, especially her brother Ross, for having been extremely overweight
                as a child.Monica is an intelligent, kind-hearted person who works primarily as a chef at a variety of restaurants throughout the show.In the second season, Monica falls for her father Jack's (Elliott Gould) friend, Richard Burke (Tom Selleck).
                Despite the twenty-one year age difference, Monica and Richard are happy, and her parents accept their relationship. However, as a result of Monica yearning for a family but Richard having already had one, they break up at the end of the second
                season. Monica then pursues a chain of various men until she unexpectedly begins a relationship with her longtime friend, Chandler Bing, at the end of the fourth season, during her brother Ross' wedding to Emily Waltham. Monica and Chandler
                try to hide their relationship from the rest of the group for much of the fifth season, but eventually everyone finds out. After celebrating their first anniversary in Las Vegas, they move in together and get engaged by the sixth-season finale.
                After their marriage, Monica and Chandler try to conceive children, only to discover that they are unable to do so. In the final season of the series, they adopt two children, whom they name Erica and Jack. <a class="reef" href="#top">Top</a><br>

                with somewhat unusual lyrics at the coffee shop. She has an identical twin sister, Ursula (also played by Kudrow), who is just as odd as Phoebe and appeared as a recurring character on Mad About You. After a series of dates and relationships
                with a number of men, Phoebe meets Mike Hannigan (Paul Rudd) in season nine, whom she eventually marries in season ten. She also became a surrogate mother for her half-brother Frank Jr. (Giovanni Ribisi), giving birth to his triplets in the

                  <h3>Rachel Green,</h3>
                </a>Rachel Karen Green (Jennifer Aniston) is the spoiled but warm-hearted and likeable daughter of a rich vascular surgeon and his wife. Rachel is introduced into the series in the first episode after she leaves her fiancé, Barry, at the altar,
                and attempts to live independently without financial support from her parents. She flees from her almost-wedding to New York City to find Monica Geller, her friend from high school. Rachel moves into Monica's apartment and meets Phoebe Buffay,
                and Joey Tribbiani. Rachel already knows Ross Geller, Monica's brother, as all three went to the same high school and also Chandler Bing as he was Ross's college buddy. Rachel's first job is as a waitress at Central Perk coffee house. She later
                begins to work in fashion, becoming an assistant buyer, and later a personal shopper, at Bloomingdale's. She eventually becomes a buyer at Polo Ralph Lauren. A great deal of Rachel's life throughout the series revolves around her relationship
                with Ross Geller. At the end of season seven, during Monica's and Chandler's wedding, it is revealed that Rachel is pregnant from a one-night stand with Ross. Initially, Rachel is determined to raise the baby on her own, but later she realizes
                she needs Ross's help. She decides to move in with Ross, even though the two are not involved in a relationship. Their daughter, Emma, is born during the eighth-season finale. During the tenth season, Rachel is offered a job with Louis Vuitton
                in Paris. She accepts and prepares to move herself and Emma to France. However, in the series finale, she declines the job offer and famously "gets off the plane". Rachel and Ross get back together in the final moments of the series. <a class="reef"

                </a>Dr. Ross Eustace Geller, Ph.D. (David Schwimmer) is a paleontologist at a museum of prehistory, and later a professor of paleontology at New York University. The most intelligent of the six main characters, but at the same time a clumsy, quirky
                man, Ross is known for being a know-it-all who prides himself on his rationality, despite his clear hopeless romanticism. Ross is Monica's older brother, Chandler's college roommate, and Rachel's on-again, off-again boyfriend. He has three failed
                marriages during the series, and his turbulent relationship with Rachel is a main storyline throughout the series. He is also the father of his ex-wife Carol's son, Ben, and Rachel's daughter, Emma. In the series finale, Ross and Rachel finally
                reconcile, deciding to be together once and for all. Before being cast in Friends, Schwimmer played minor characters in The Wonder Years and NYPD Blue; his first regular series role was in the sitcom Monty. Schwimmer is the only cast member

              at Central Perk after running away from her wedding to her fiancé Barry and moves into an apartment with her friend Monica from high school. Ross, who has had a crush on Rachel since the two of them were in high school, constantly attempts to
              tell her how he feels about her. However, many obstacles stand in his way, such as the fact that he is expecting a baby with his lesbian ex-wife, Carol. Joey is shown to be a bachelor and struggling actor, while Phoebe works as a masseuse and
              portrays a sort of "crazy" attribute to her personality based on her troubles as a child after her mother committed suicide. However the rest of the group loves her regardless. Chandler breaks up with girlfriend Janice (Maggie Wheeler), who frequently
              returns in later seasons. At the end of the season, Chandler accidentally reveals that Ross loves Rachel, who realizes that she feels the same way. The season ends with Rachel waiting at the airport for Ross’ arrival from a trip. <a class="reef"

              in the bathroom at Monica and Chandler's apartment belongs to Rachel. Rachel takes another pregnancy test, which Phoebe at first claims is negative, in order to achieve Rachel's real emotions on the realization of being pregnant. Rachel projects
              feelings of sadness when she thinks she's not pregnant, so Phoebe tells her the truth. The two of them and Monica then rejoice in the bathroom. The season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy; Ross is revealed to be the father after an investigation
              involving a red sweater. Rachel and Ross decide to have the baby but do not resume their romantic relationship. Joey develops romantic feelings for Rachel, but she does not reciprocate them. Rachel gives birth to baby Emma in the season finale.
              At the hospital, Ross's mother offers him an engagement ring because she wants him to marry Rachel. Ross does not intend to ask Rachel to marry him, but he takes the ring anyway and puts it in his jacket pocket. Meanwhile, in the post-delivery
              room, Joey looks for some tissue for an upset Rachel, picks up Ross's jacket, and the ring falls to the floor. He kneels to pick it up and turns to Rachel, still on his knees and still holding the ring. Rachel accepts what she thinks is his proposal
              of marriage. <a class="reef" href="#top">Top</a>

              Joey in the middle of the season, and Rachel develops romantic feelings for him, while the rest of the "friends" try hard to get Ross and Rachel back together. The group travels to Barbados in the finale to hear Ross give a keynote speech at a

              and are chosen by Erica (Anna Faris). In the series finale, Erica gives birth to twins, to the surprise of Monica and Chandler — a boy, Jack (after Monica's father), and a girl, Erica (named after the birth mother). Monica and Chandler prepare
              to move to the suburbs, and Joey becomes upset with the changes in his life. Rachel gets fired from her job and accepts a new offer in Paris, but Ross, realizing he loves her, chases after her. Rachel realizes she loves him, too, and cancels her
              flight to Paris, agreeing to stay with him. The series ends with all the friends plus Monica and Chandler's new babies leaving the apartment, heading to Central Perk for a final cup of coffee. The finale dialogue used in this series is by Chandler,
              making a joke for the last time. The camera's last view is of all of the character's keys to the apartment on the counter table, finishing with a shot of the apartment door. <a class="reef" href="#top">Top</a><br>
